    <p>As part of creating an engaging user interface, front end app development often focus on specific design elements such as text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, and overall color schemes. These elements play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the application. </p>

Same as above, research job postings in your area to see what libraries and frameworks are being used.Some of the popular libraries are <b>React</b>,<b>Angular</b> and <b>Vue</b>. These frameworks and libraries allow you to save time and do more with less code.</p>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging skills</h2>
    <p>As you are developing your application, there will be errors in your code that need fixing. Debugging is the act of identifying those errors ("bugs") and fixing them.Testing is another important skill to learn. Writing tests for your code is a way to ensure that your code is doing what it is supposed to do.</p>
